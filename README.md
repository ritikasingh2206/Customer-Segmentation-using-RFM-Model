# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Model
"In my recent project, I analysed online retail data using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviour. By leveraging Python programming and various data analysis libraries, I conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover insights into customer demographics and purchase patterns. Through meticulous data preprocessing and segmentation techniques, I categorised customers into distinct segments, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing strategies effectively. This project demonstrates my expertise in data analytics and provides actionable insights to drive business growth."
